This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where asynchronous operations can cause the server to hang if exceptions aren't properly handled.  The `serverBug.js` file showcases a server that may become unresponsive.  The solution (`serverSolution.js`) provides a corrected version using `try...catch` blocks within the asynchronous operation to manage potential errors and prevent the server from crashing.  This is essential for robust server-side applications.
